=head1 NAME

Doxygen::Filter::Perl::POD - A perl code pre-filter for Doxygen

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Doxygen::Filter::Perl::POD is a helper module for use with Doxygen::Filter::Perl
and should not be called directly.  This class actually overloads some of the methods
found in Pod::POM::View::HTML and converts their output to be in a Doxygen style that
Doxygen::Filter::Perl can use.  The reason I went this route is Pod::POM appears to 
be well established and pretty good at parsing POD.  I thus did not want to reinvent
the wheel when it appears that this wheel works pretty well.  Now this class should
probably find its way in to the Pod::POM::View tree at some point.  But for now it
is here.
